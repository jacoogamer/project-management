## Getting Started

### 1. Create Your First Portfolio
Start by opening the Portfolio view and creating a portfolio to organize your projects:

1. Open the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`)
2. Search for "Project Management: Open Projects" and select it, or use the ribbon icon in the left sidebar
3. Use the "+" button to create your first portfolio
4. Your portfolio will serve as a container for related projects
5. You can use the description textarea to add a brief description of the portfolio

### 2. Create Projects Using the Button
Once you have a portfolio set up, create projects using the built-in project creation feature:

1. In the Portfolio view, click the **"Create Project"** button
2. The plugin will ask you where to create the project file
3. This will create a new project note with the proper front matter structure (you can override this with a custom template in settings)
4. The project will automatically include the required `project: true` flag (this flag name can be customized in settings)
5. Edit the generated project note to add your specific details

```yaml
---
project: true
description: "Your project description"
start-date: 2024-01-01
end-date: 2024-12-31
priority: high
area: development
---
```

### 3. Add Tasks to Your Project File
In the generated project note, add tasks using the Epic (E-), Story (S-), and Sub-task (SB-) format. You can delete the default tasks and add your own. Tasks are currently based on Obsidian's native task format (markdown checkboxes), and task support may be expanded in future versions.

### 4. Enhance Tasks with Properties in Your Project File
Add inline properties directly to tasks in your project note for better tracking, such as assignee, due dates, and start dates. These properties are parsed from the task text and integrated into the project management views
